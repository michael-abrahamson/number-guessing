# Number Guessing Game (Java)

This is an introductory project from the roadmap.sh Backend Developer Roadmap focused on practicing core Java fundamentals.

The goal of this project was to reinforce:

- Public classes and class structure
- Constructors
- Getters and setters
- The @Override annotation (specifically toString())

This project was completed post-interview with AcumenSoftware, which is why the above goals were outlined as these are similar to what i was asked on during teh interview where i gave lackluster performance
